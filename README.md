This repo contains sample applications written in C# that run on Google Cloud Platform.

See [https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/getting-started/hello-world](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/getting-started/hello-world) for instructions on how to build, run, and deploy the samples.

The applications make use of two client libraries:

* [.NET Cloud Client Library]
* [Google API Client Library]
